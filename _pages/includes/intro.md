Hi! I am Runbo Yu (余润博), a sophomore undergraduate in [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/). I major in Computer Science and minor in Mathematics. In 2024 Summer, I visited UC Berkeley. Currently, My research focus on Statistical Learning Theory, especially problems on generalization and deep learning interpretation. I believe that rigorous theoretical framework will provide us with a necessary insight to mechanisms and behaviors of neural networks, which should be highlighted to match our high-level intuitions. If you share a similar interest with me, please feel free to contact me!
