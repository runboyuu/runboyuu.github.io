# Misc
I like playing video games. eg. Baldur's Gate 3, Dark Souls, Witcher 3. I am learning basic machine learning related game development on hugging face.

Also, I enjoy watching animations. if you are a fan of EVA, Attack on Titan or Death Note, please feel free to chat with me. Moreover, Soccer is my favorite sport and I am a fan of Real Madrid.
